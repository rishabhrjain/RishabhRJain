### Hello! I am Rishabh Jain 

Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience harnessing data to drive impactful solutions using AI and Machine Learning.

Here are a few learnings from my own experience and experts in the field:
1. We don't need Machine Learning for all problems presented to us. Even when we do, it's good to evaluate how it will add value to the business.
2. Quality of data is paramount. Always be data-centric, not model-centric.
3. We need to be aware of state-of-the-art models, but not necessarily use them to solve every problem. For example, is it worth doubling the inference time for a 5% increase in accuracy?
4. Model evaluation and monitoring are as critical as everything above.

I learn to make machines learn. I love trekking, calisthenics, ultimate frisbee, and basketball. My cover photo is from a trek in the Himalayas.
